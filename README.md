Create a two page site. The site will have an input page and an output page.

User will input info on input page that will drive the look of the output page.

Input page must have's:

- long form text box with spell check to format a message that will appear on the output page
- means to pick a visual theme for output page (at least three themes to pick from)
- a button to launch output page

Output page must have's:

- git information to allow us to review your code
- button back to input page

- Use your best judgement on any details you think are missing and fill in the blanks however you wish.
